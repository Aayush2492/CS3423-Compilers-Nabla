## Autodiff Objectives


---

* Develop classes for each operator and overload them for different Datatypes
* The datatypes for Tensor will always be a two dimensional vector
* The datatypes for a Constant will always be a single constant may be a float or an integer 
* Create a function that will belong to the Computational graph and will create a mul node and acess its forward function.


* The _matmul function will take in two nodes and internally call tensor mult operation, while creating an operator Node.

## Challenge: Support for scalar variables needs to be added.
## Challenge: support for scalar constants needs to be added.
## Challenge: Support for scalar multiplication needs to be added.
